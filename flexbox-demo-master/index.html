        <p>Hey, I'm Sarah! I received my bachelor's degree in English with concentrations in rhetoric and global culture from Binghamton University. After holding various leadership positions on the undergraduate newspaper, I decided to pursue my master's degree in journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.  </p>
        <p>My main journalistic interests are housing, policing and prisons and right-wing violence. I hope to work in independent news media, free from the influence of corporate interests. </p>

              <p>For people like myself who view the Democratic Party as much more centrist than progressive, seeing these more left-leaning women in Congress was, at the least, refreshing and a small step in the right direction.
                However, predictably, Democrats are doing all they can to stifle the more progressive views of these officials. This is a mistake.</p>

            <p>What both sides have in common, though, is that their views are largely shaped by media representation of what’s happening in Venezuela. Here’s the problem: If the United States has its own interests
              — propping up a leader who will cooperate with the United States — how do we know that mainstream media remains unbiased in its reports on Venezuela?</p>

            <p>For people struggling financially, it could seem like an answer to their prayers — and there lies the problem. In a country where student loan debt is at an all-time high at $1.56 trillion,
              where skyrocketing drug prices are directly killing Americans, military recruitment centered on the financial benefits of joining can only be referred to as predatory.</p>
